# extreme_test.s
# Derived from user's extreme_test.s (base file). This version adds full J-type coverage:
# setx, bex, jal, jr, and j — combined with the original blocks that test ALU, shifts, lw/sw, overflow, branches, etc.

# Block K: Jump & Status tests (NEW)
#   - Tests setx / bex (status + conditional jump)
#   - Tests jal / jr (call/return)
#   - Tests j (unconditional jump)
# --------------------

# 1) Test setx + bex: set status, then bex should jump when rstatus != 0
setx  0x0000002A         # $30 (rstatus) = 0x2A (42)  [setx takes a JI immediate; assembler should accept hex or decimal]

# If bex fails, this addi will execute; it should be skipped
addi  $1, $0, 99         # skipped if bex worked
SKIP_BEX:
addi  $1, $0, 11         # $1 = 11  (marker that bex jumped)

# 2) Test jal / jr: call a function that modifies registers, then jr $31 returns
#    We place the call so that the saved return address (PC + 1) is well-defined by labels.
jal CALLER_FUNC          # $31 = PC+1 ; jump to CALLER_FUNC
# After returning from jr $31, the next instruction executed should be here:
addi  $5, $0, 0          # (placeholder) ensure location after return - we'll overwrite with meaningful op later
# use an unconditional jump to skip over a stub block
j     AFTER_STUB

# Stub area that should be skipped by j above
STUB:
addi $5, $0, 99          # should be skipped by j
j     CONTINUE_SKIPPED

AFTER_STUB:
# continue normal flow after returning from CALLER_FUNC
addi $6, $0, 6           # set $6 to 6 as a marker (will overwrite earlier $6 value; this checks return flow)

# CALLER_FUNC: do some work then return using jr $31
CALLER_FUNC:
addi $2, $0, 2           # $2 = 2 (local)
addi $3, $0, -5          # $3 = -5 (re-assert)
addi $4, $0, 4           # $4 = 4
# set a marker register inside function
addi $7, $0, 77          # $7 = 77
jr   $31                 # return to saved PC in $31

CONTINUE_SKIPPED:
# 3) Test unconditional j: jump ahead to J_TARGET
j     J_TARGET
# code here should be skipped
addi  $8, $0, 99         # skipped by j

J_TARGET:
addi  $8, $0, 8          # $8 = 8  (marker that j worked)

# 4) Test setx/bex interaction with zero: setx to 0 then bex must NOT jump
setx 0                   # clear rstatus
bex  SKIP_NO_JUMP        # should NOT jump since rstatus == 0
addi $9, $0, 99          # should be executed if bex does NOT jump
SKIP_NO_JUMP:
# keep $9 set to 99 as marker
addi $9, $0, 99
