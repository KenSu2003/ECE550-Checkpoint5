Few notes from the wave form

Problem 1:

0x10440001 keeps repeated twice and I do not see the blt

    -- bne  $1, $2, bne_true

0003 : 00010000010001000000000000000001;



Problem 2. 

# Time               390000: PC=17 Instr=2a800001

This line was executed

    -- addi $10, $0, 1         # $10 = 1

0019 : 00101010100000000000000000000001;

yet $r10 was not written.


Problem 3
29C00063 was not executed
    -- addi $7, $0, 99       # $7 = 99 (should later be changed to 7)
0009 : 00101001110000000000000001100011;
# Time               190000: PC=7 Instr=2941ffff
# Time               210000: PC=8 Instr=31420001


Problem 4
Because of problem 3
it cause this to run
addi $6, $0, -1     # Skipped


problem 5
# Time               350000: PC=15 Instr=2a800063
#   Write observed: REG r9 <= 0x00000001


that instruction should be 
    -- addi $10, $0, 99         # $10 = 99 (should later be changed to 1)
